##Introduction
The game of Spies and Medics is a card game that takes influence from many historical as well as contemporary sources.
From archaic War to modern Witcher 3, the card game is a weird emalgameted love child and homage to old fashioned and new card games.

##Rules

###General

2 Players.

For this game a deck of 52 cards (A-K, no jokers) is required.

Each player has 2 lanes, one for red cards, one for black cards.

A player must win two rounds out of three in order to win the match.

Rounds and matches can end in a draw.

Each player is given 10 cards.

At the beginning of the game, a coin is flipped and whoever wins drafts first, and the other starts first.

###Phases

Coin Flip -> Draft Phase -> Turn Phase

###Drafting
As determined by the coin toss, whoever drafts first must discard one card from their hand, then draws one from the deck.

After doing so, the other player discards and draws.

The first player discards and draws again.

The other player discards then draws once more.

All cards discarded in the drafting phase go into the side pile.

After the drafting phase is done, the first turn can begin.

###Rounds
The player who drafted second, places the first card.

Each turn a player can play one card or pass.

If a player passes they won't be able to put down a card until the next round.

The remaining player can play as many cards as they want until they also pass.

Whoever has the highest point value, after both players pass, wins the round.

If a player wins the first round, they draw 2 cards, and their opponent draws 1 card.

If a player wins the second round, and the match hasn't ended, then they draw 3 cards, while their opponent draws 2 cards.

If a round ends in a draw, then both players draw 2 cards.

When a round ends, all cards on each player's side of the field will go into their respective discard pile regardless of original ownership.

The score is set to 0 on both sides once a round ends.

All modifiers and side cards go to the side pile.

For the next round, the player that went second previously, goes first.

##Cards
* **Aces** - Modifiers

* **2**- Modifiers

* **3**- Nullify

* **4 -> 10** - Value Cards

* **J and K** - Spies (draw 1, has a value of 5 and is placed in the opponents field, as well as adding to your opponent's current round score)

* **Q** - Medics (revive 1 card from the player's discard pile, has a value of 5 and placed in the opponents field, as well as adding to your opponent's current round score)


###Modifiers and Nullifies
If a Row Modifier is played, then each card in the Modifier's color row is worth a value of 1 instead of their number value.

If another modifier is placed, then it replaces the effect of the existing modifier, which is placed in the side pile.

If a Nullify is placed, it replaces the current modifier and also goes into the side pile.

A modifier can even be placed on a modifier if it has the same effect.

A nullify can be played even if there is no modifier on the field.

###Spies and Medics
All face cards are worth a value of 5 for the opposing player.

They are played on the enemy's side of the field in their respective color row.

A spy allows the player that plays it to draw 1 card.

A medic, however, allows the player that plays it to revive 1 value or spy card from their discard pile and place it just as they were from their hand.

A spy and a medic can also be played on your side of the field, but are only worth 3 points.
